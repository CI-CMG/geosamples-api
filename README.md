# IMLGS API

a simple RESTful API for read-only access to the Index to Marine and Lacustrine Geological Samples (IMLGS) database.
Although it can be used independently, many of the endpoints are designed to support the [IMLGS web application](https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/imlgs)

Resources exposed via the API include:
* Geosamples
* Cruises
* Repositories (aka Facilities)

Partial OpenAPI format documentation may be viewed via [Swagger UI](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geosamples-api/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geosamples-api/swagger-config.json). 
See [notes](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/curator/curatorcoding.html) 
on the database fields underlying the API
